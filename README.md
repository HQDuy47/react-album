# React with API

Develop a website with the following features:

1.  Implement the ability to search for photos and display images that match the search text.
2.  Allow users to scroll down to load additional photos dynamically.
3.  Show a loading indication to inform users when the website is waiting for a response from the photo search API.
4.  Deploy the website to a public host for accessibility to a broader audience.
